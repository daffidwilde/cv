\section{Relevant Experience}

\cventry{2018--present}{Assessment Assistant}{Cardiff University}{Cardiff}{}{%
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Computational Methods:} I have acted as part of the
            assessment team for this Master's module on a yearly basis. The
            assessment is comprised of a twenty-four hour hackathon involving
            several dozen students and my role has been to gauge, then rank,
            their abilities to work in teams to develop a piece of software for
            a certain mathematical task.
    \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{2017--present}{Module Tutor}{Cardiff University}{Cardiff}{}{%
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Computing for Mathematics:} An introductory course on
            using Python for mathematics. I support this module by supervising
            weekly computer lab sessions for groups of students as part of an
            active learning framework which is fed back to the module leader.
        \item \textbf{Statistical Inference:} First year module building on
            A-level statistics. My role includes running fortnightly classes for
            multiple groups of students. The purpose of these sessions is to
            provide feedback and to explore material covered in recent lectures.
        \item \textbf{Maths Support:} A weekly drop-in session for students at
            all levels from across all the schools within the university. There
            is little prep that can be done and so tutors are required to come
            ready to think on their feet covering a variety of mathematical
            fields.
