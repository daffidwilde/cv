\cvitem{Description}{\small%
    The purpose of this project is to investigate variation in the service and
    cost of treating hospital patients in the Cwm Taf region of South Wales. My
    thesis focusses on identifying and analysing structures in the data of
    patients, and their treatments and associated clinical processes. By doing
    so, the system can be segmented without an external framework thus more
    clearly illustrating its dependencies and connections. The thesis also
    incorporates an extensive analysis of how algorithms are evaluated, and a
    toolkit on large-scale data science and software development best practices.

\section{Relevant Experience}

\cventry{2019}{Project Allocation}{Cardiff University}{}{}{%
    Two schools within the university have approached me to install a new
    framework for allocating students to projects in their final year. Making
    use of the matching library I maintain, I have been able to reduce the
    bulk workload of the teams down from a week to a matter of seconds. In doing
    so, the provided solution is both stable and student-optimal with almost all
    students the being allocated their first or second choice. This work is
    largely independent and the next step I wish to take is to develop a
    supporting browser-based app for schools to use, and a subsequent
    academic publication.
}

\cventry{2018--present}{Assessment Advisor}{Cardiff University}{}{}{%
    I have acted as part of the assessment team for a Master's module on
    computational methods since the 2017/18 academic year. The assessment
    consists of a two-day hackathon involving several dozen students and my role
    has been to gauge and rank their abilities to work in teams to develop a
    piece of software for a certain mathematical task.
}

\cventry{2018--present}{Maths Support Assistant}{Cardiff University}{}{}{%
    I provide mathematical aid to students from all schools
    within the university as part of the Maths Support Service. This drop-in
    service affords little scope for preparation and requires me to make use of
    my nature as a mathematician \-- to be proactive, analytical and logical \--
    often covering far-reaching branches of mathematics in a session.
}

\cventry{2017--present}{Module Tutor}{Cardiff University}{}{}{%
    Throughout my time as a postgraduate student, I have supported a number of
    modules as a tutor where my primary role is to lead weekly sessions with
    students. These sessions follow up on the content covered in lectures and I
    then assess the progress of the students. This role has given me countless
    opportunities to teach in group and one-on-one settings, and to play a key
    role in several active learning schemes.
